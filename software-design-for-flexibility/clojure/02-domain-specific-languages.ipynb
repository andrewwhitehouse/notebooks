    "The use of functional notation in mathematics is a combinator discipline. A function has a domain, from which its arguments are selected, and a range (or co-domain) of its possible values. There are combinators that produce new functions as combinations of others. For example the composition f &compfn; g of functions f and g is a new function that takes arguments in the domain of g and produces values in the codomain of f.\n",

Languages that allow first-class procedures provide a mechanism to support this means of combination, but what really matters is a good family of pieces."

Any combination yields a legal programme, whose behaviour transparently depends only on the behaviours of the parts and the way that they are combined. The context in whch a part appears does not change the behaviour of the part: it is always acceptable to pick up a component part to use it in a new context, without worry about its behaviour in that context. Thus such programmes are easy to write, easy to read, and easy to verify. _A programme built on combinators is extensible, because introduction of new parts or new combinators does not affect the behaviour of existing programmes._"
