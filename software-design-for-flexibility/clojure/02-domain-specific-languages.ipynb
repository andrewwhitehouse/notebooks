    "The use of functional notation in mathematics is a combinator discipline. A function has a domain, from which its arguments are selected, and a range (or co-domain) of its possible values. There are combinators that produce new functions as combinations of others. For example the composition f &compfn; g of functions f and g is a new function that takes arguments in the domain of g and produces values in the codomain of f.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two functions have the same domain and codomain, and if arithmetic is defined on their common codomain, then we can define the sum (or product) of the functions as the function that, when given an argument in their common domain, is the sum (or product) of the values of the two functions at that argument. Languages that allow first-class procedures provide a mechanism to support this means of combination, but what really matters is a good family of pieces."

    "Organizing a system around combinators has several advantages. The parts taht are made can be arbitrarily mixed and matched. Any combination yields a legal programme, whose behaviour transparently depends only on the behaviours of the parts and the way that they are combined. The context in whch a part appears does not change the behaviour of the part: it is always acceptable to pick up a component part to use it in a new context, without worry about its behaviour in that context. Thus such programmes are easy to write, easy to read, and easy to verify. _A programme built on combinators is extensible, because introduction of new parts or new combinators does not affect the behaviour of existing programmes._"
