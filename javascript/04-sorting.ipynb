    "In real life, many business systems don't use these algorithms. I know, because I've been working in that domain for the past 30 years. Perhaps if you work in investment banking you'll see more numerical optimisation algorithms. \n",

    "Let's assume your system handles customers, and those customers have addresses. \n",

    "You store all of their addresses. (Actually, you probably shouldn't do that under the GDPR principle of storing data for no longer than is necessary and reasonable. But let's assume you can justify that point.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the customer has different types of address, and only one of those types can be active at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you want to send the customer a letter; you need to find their current active correspondence address. As there probably aren't too many addresses for that customer you could load them all and scan the results for addressType='correspondence' and active=true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, you have millions of customers and you want to retrieve the ones who live in Birmingham and have placed order in the past year, that could be a larger data set. A larger data set can take longer to process and so we may need a different approach to ensure we return results quickly enough for our users.\n",
