That's because it's distributed in every web browser, and has also graduated to the code that runs behind the scenes (which we call the _back end_). JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means the interpreter figures out the type of the _variable_ you're working with when you create it ... often based on what's on the right hand side of the equals."
